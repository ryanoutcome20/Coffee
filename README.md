## Installation

You can install Coffee via the [releases](https://github.com/ryanoutcome20/Coffee/releases/) or manually by following these steps:

1. Cloning the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryanoutcome20/coffee.git
   ```
2. Dragging and dropping into your Garry's Mod folder located in:
   ```
   Steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/
   ```
3. Running via the console command:
   ```lua
   lua_openscript_cl coffee/main.lua
   ```

Note that the server must have **sv_allowcslua** enabled for this command to work. Also note that Coffee relies on external modules to extend its functionality, supported modules include:
  * [zxcmodule](https://github.com/ryanoutcome20/zxcmodule)
  * [proxi](https://github.com/homonovus)

It is likely you'll crash with zxcmodule due to load order issues. To fix this you must run:

```lua
lua_run_cl require("zxcmodule")
```

Do this **before** loading Coffee.

## Opening

Once loaded you can open the menu and begin configuring the trainer via the keybind **INSERT**. To open a tab click on the name of the tab located in the bottom left of your screen.
